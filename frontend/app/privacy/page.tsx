                  Most information about farmers and other participants is provided

                  teams, rather than collected by us directly. For this data the
                  Customer is the controller and decides the legal basis. That
                  basis is often the performance of a contract or programme, the
                  Customer&apos;s legitimate interests, or a legal obligation, and
                  it is not necessarily consent. We do not assume that farmer data
                  is collected on the basis of consent.

                  Because this data is generally not collected from the individual
                  directly, the transparency obligations under Article 14 GDPR
                  apply to the Customer as controller. The Customer is responsible
                  for informing the individuals concerned, for example through a
                  participant privacy notice, and for having a valid basis to
                  record and share the data. Shamba supports the Customer in
                  meeting these obligations but does not provide notices to
                  participants on its own behalf.
